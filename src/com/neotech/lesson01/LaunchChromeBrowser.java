		//1. Open the browser
//		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		
		//2. Go to the url 
//		driver.get("https://www.neotechacademy.com/");
		
		
		//3. Perform the test steps 
		
		
		
		//The code is very fast, as soon as the browser opens, then it performs the steps, and then closes.
		//If we want to reduce the speed for debugging (without actually running a debug), then we stop the code for some seconds.
		
		Thread.sleep(5000); //pause the execution for 5 seconds at this line
		
		//4. Quit the browser
//		driver.quit();
		
		
		
		
		// Test 1 :)
